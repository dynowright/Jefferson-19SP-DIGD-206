To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Celebrate Princeton Invention (now Innovation), I proposed a back cover cover concept for the 2018 brochure showing the previous nine brochures.

I thought it would be fun to show a tiger looking all of the brochures, then the idea evolved into a tiger looking the brochures at a museum display.

I used Photoshop to add a watercolor effect on the original brochures. (Original on left, watercolor on right)

Then I adapted some stock photography for the museum floor in Photoshop.

We never heard back from the copyright holder of the first tiger image I tried to use. So instead, we used a different tiger.

After a suggestion from the CPI committee, I re-cropped the nine brochures to have consistent dimensions.

The final draft included a small addition of "Celebrate Princeton Innovation 2018" text on the museum wall.

This is the final draft of the illustration to be used as the back cover of the 2018 brochure.
